#project insights

•  Understand customer profiles – by showing sales segmented by marital status, region, and education.
•  Analyze income levels – to see how average income impacts bike purchase decisions across gender.
•  Study age influence – through customer age brackets and their relation to bike purchases.
•  Examine commute distance – to check how far customers travel and whether that affects the likelihood of purchasing a bike.
•  Compare purchase vs. non-purchase trends – in all segments (income, age, distance, etc.).

#Final Conclusion

The Bike Sale Dashboard reveals that customer demographics such as age, gender, marital status, region, and education, along with factors like income level and commute distance, significantly influence bike purchase decisions. Middle-aged customers with higher incomes are the most likely to purchase bikes, while purchasing patterns vary across regions and educational backgrounds.

Overall, the insights indicate that targeting middle-aged, higher-income professionals—particularly those with shorter commutes—can maximize bike sales. Marketing strategies should therefore focus on these key customer segments to improve sales performance and profitability.
